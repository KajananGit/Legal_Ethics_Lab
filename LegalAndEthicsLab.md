# Legal and Ethical Standards Lab ⚖️


## Scenario 1


### Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?
Although users are infromed via an email about the new partnership and the usage of their data, there might be legal complications on how the infromation is being interpreted. 

It seems like the partnership breaks the law by interpreting the new changes as part of the company's Terms and Conditions. Any infromation about how a user's data is being handled should be preseted within the cookies and privacy policies. A user should be made aware of their rights and how their data is being collected and used.

Based on the description of scenario 1 the folowing questions arise: 
- Are users able to opt-out from their data to being sold to the PayDay loan company?
- When will the user be informed about the implementation of the new change?
- How do they ensure that the third-party companies do not sell the infromation to other/addtional third-party companies?

### What are the ethical concerns with the company's proposal *?
- It does not seem ethical to offer further loans to people who are already financially struggling to pay off their initial debt with the bank. If anything, it could put them in a even worse financial situation than they were in proir by having them taking out more loans than they are qualified for/can handle.
- How do they ensure that the algorithm used is not bias?

### What could the company do to address these issues?
- The company should re-evaluate the morality of this partnership and conduct further research on the potential consequences it could have on the bank, it's customers, and it's reputation. 
- Conduct further research on the third-party company on why they might have recently recieved negative publicity. Could it be becasue they might have operated unethically or broken the law?
- Ensure that their users/customers are made aware of the new changes through multiple communication channels (most importantly it should be highlighted within the privacy policies).
- Customers should have the right to opt-out from their data being sold to the PayDay loan company. (As everyone has the right for privacy!)
