# Legal and Ethical Standards Lab


## Scenario 1


### Is the company breaking any laws with their proposal?
Although users are infromed via an email about the new partnership and the usage of their data, there might be legal complications on how the infromation is being interpreted. 

It seems like the partnership breaks the law by interpreting the new changes as part of the company's Terms and Conditions. Any infromation about how a user's data is being handled should be preseted within the cookies and privacy policies. A user should be made aware of their rights and how their data is being collected and used.

Based on the description of scenario 1 the folowing questions arise: 
- Are users able to opt-out from their data to being sold to the PayDay loan company?
- When will the user be informed about the implementation of the new change?
